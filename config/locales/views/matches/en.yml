          The score must be identical in the <i>score_winner</i> and <i>score_winner2</i> columns, and entered as the winner's score
          (e.g., 4-2 1-3 10-7); the winner is the player with 20 points (<i>points_player</i> or <i>points_opponent</i>).
          A round with four players per box will consist of 6 matches, therefore 6 rows per box:
          <ul>
          <li>player 1 : player 2</li>
          <li>player 1 : player 3</li>
          <li>player 1 : player 4</li>
          <li>player 2 : player 3</li>
          <li>player 2 : player 4</li>
          <li>player 3 : player 4</li>
          </ul>
          If a box has fewer players, the CSV file will include empty rows to ensure the same number of rows for all boxes.
