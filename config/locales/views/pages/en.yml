        Box Leagues are designed to enable members of %{clubname} to <i class='color-tennis-aqua'>play competitive tennis against other members of their club</i> on a regular basis.
        They are an ideal way to meet other members and build a broader network of players for social games.
      p02_html: >
        However, box leagues only work if players are <i class='color-tennis-aqua'>committed to getting matches played</i>. Members who enter the leagues must make
        every effort to complete their fixture programme. If, for whatever reason, players are unable to fulfil fixtures they
        should notify opponents and Referee promptly.
      p03_html: >
        Players should <i class='color-tennis-aqua'>notify their opponents to block out the dates or times they are not available to play matches</i> as well as
        advertise the dates and times they would like to play matches. This simple application of good time management principles
        will make it easier to schedule your matches.

      li03: If in doubt, the player must give the benefit of the doubt to the opponent.
      li04: >
        If a player incorrectly calls a ball “out” and then realizes that the ball was good, the point should be replayed
        unless it was a point winning shot or unless that player made an incorrect “out” call earlier in the match.
        In these circumstances the player who called “out” loses the point.
